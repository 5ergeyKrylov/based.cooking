# Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo

Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo is one of the best tasting and low effort dishes.
The recipe I give below yields an Alfredo sauce that is a bit on the thicker side.
If you want a thinner sauce, adding a touch or two more milk will thin out the sauce.
This is a great meal for 3-4 people or you can eat one serving and freeze the rest for 2-3 more dinners.

- Prep time: 5-10 minutes
- Cook time: 10-20 minutes (Noodles take most of the time)
- Servings: 3-4

## Ingredients

- 1 8oz Cream Cheese
- 1lb Uncoocked Peeled Shrimp
- 1/3 Cup Milk (More milk for thinner sauce)
- 3/4 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
- 2 Tblsp Butter
- 1 Tsp Garlic Powder
- Pasta Noodles of Choice
  - E.g. Approximately 9oz of Fettuccine Noodles

## Directions

### Initial Preparation (5-10 minutes)
1. Grate your Parmesan Cheese
2. Peel your shrimp

The dish has two main parts--the Pasta and the Alfredo Sauce.
In order that you can have both finish about the same time, I have given estimates on the individual cook times.

### Preparing the Pasta (10-20 minutes)
1. In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a rapid boil.
2. Turn down to medium heat (Simmering).
3. Add your pasta noodles.

### Preparing the Alfredo Sauce (7-10 minutes)
1. In a large frying pan, add butter, garlic powder, and shrimp.
2. On medium heat, saut&#233; ingredients until shrimp are cooked.
3. Then add the cream cheese broken into chunks.
4. Stir until creamy.
5. Once cream cheese is to sauce consistency, add milk.
6. Stir until light simmer.
7. Add parmesan cheese and continue stirring.
8. Stir until cheese is mixed.
9. Remove from heat.

### Serving
1. Strain cooked pasta noodles.
2. Serve the strained noodles on a plate and top with Alfredo sauce.
